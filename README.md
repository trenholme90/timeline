# Timeline

I just wanted to make a cool timeline application

Tools:

- Vue.js
- Sass
- ES6

A timeline that shows content only when it is in view for the user. It is a responsive design with a different layout on mobile compared to desktop and tablet.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
